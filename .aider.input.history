+A slot machine with 3 columns and 3 rows, each slot contains one fruit. The fruits should be: Apple, Banana, Cherry, Lemon. Generate an vector style image with white background for each fruit and use it to display that fruit. The fruits should be spawned by the machine at random. The user can press the spin button, which will trigger a spinning animation that moves the columns downward, spawning new fruit at the top repeatedly for 2 seconds. If there are 3 of the same fruit in any row or column at any time while not spinning, display a win message to the user, which they can share on their feed. Check the win condition directly using a conditional render instead of calculating it in a function. The user should always be able to spin again, except while the spinning animation is in progress.

+Title: Digital Pet — "Pocket Pals"
+
+Short description:
+A simple, addictive, family-friendly digital pet mini-app. Cute pets are randomly selected with a spin wheel and given a random name. Players care for pets (feed, sleep, play, bathe), perform fun actions (jump, smile, roll, run, walk), grow levels, unlock more pets, and buy items/house with earned EXP. No backend details needed — use the Mini App Factory defaults for storage and state.
+
+Design goals:
+- Mobile-first, responsive (works on phones and desktop)
+- Bright, cute, inviting UI for kids and teens but usable by adults
+- Large visible CTAs, rounded cards, friendly font, and gentle animations
+- Generator should provide placeholder cute illustrations for pets (or use emoji if image assets unavailable)
+
+Assets:
+- Use built-in cute pet illustrations (cat, dog, bunny, dragon, monkey, fish, bird, lion, tiger, elephant). If generator supports, prefer colorful vector/PNG images; otherwise use emoji icons.
+- Background: soft gradient (pastel blues/pinks/greens)
+- Button style: large, rounded, high-contrast text
+
+Overall flow (screens and behavior)
+1. Splash Screen (Logo)
+ - Show app logo and large background with a collage of pet images.
+ - Big visible "Get Started" button centered at bottom (large, rounded).
+ - "Get Started" navigates to Pet Selection (Spin Wheel).
+
+2. Pet Selection — Spin Wheel (Species)
+ - Screen shows a colorful spin wheel with pet icons (10 species).
+ - Button: "Spin" — spins the wheel with simple physics animation and lands on a random pet.
+ - After spin ends, show the selected pet full-screen with a cute entrance animation and a button "Spin Name" (or "Keep Pet" to re-spin species once).
+ - If user confirms species, navigate to Name Selection.
+
+3. Name Selection — Spin Wheel (Names)
+ - Show a second spin wheel for names (suggest list or generator-provided random names).
+ - Button: "Spin Name" — when wheel stops, show selected name text under pet.
+ - Button: "Accept & Start" — proceed to About / Tutorial; "Re-spin Name" allowed.
+
+4. About / Tutorial Page

+   * Move Controls: Jump, Smile, Roll, Run, Walk (each as a secondary row of buttons)

+ - Bottom navigation bar: Home, Store, Pets (inventory / other owned pets), House, Settings.
+
+6. Pets / Multi-pet Management
+ - Show list/grid of owned pets with their image, name, level.

+
+10. Settings & Save

+ - Confirm before deleting a pet.
+
+Gameplay mechanics (simple, deterministic rules for generator)
+- Data model (minimum): Pet { id, species, name, level, exp, hunger(0-100), cleanliness(0-100), happiness(0-100), energy(0-100), houseLevel, inventory[] }
+- Starting pet: level 1, exp 0, hunger 50, cleanliness 50, happiness 50, energy 50
+- EXP and leveling:
+  * Each action grants EXP: Feed +10 EXP, Play +15 EXP, Bath +8 EXP, Sleep +12 EXP, Move actions +3 EXP each (jump/smile/roll/run/walk)
+  * Experience to next level: nextLevelExp = 100 * currentLevel (so level 1 -> 100, level 2 -> 200, etc.)
+  * When pet gains enough EXP, level increments and pet growth animation plays (size/appearance improves).
+  * Every 20 levels (20, 40, 60…) unlock a new spin wheel chance to get a bonus pet.
+- Stat changes (example rules; generator can fine-tune):
+  * Feed: hunger +30 (cap 100), happiness +5, cleanliness -2
+  * Play: happiness +20, energy -10, hunger -5
+  * Bath: cleanliness +40 (cap 100), happiness +2
+  * Sleep: energy +50 (cap 100), hunger -10
+  * Move actions: small happiness +3, energy -2
+  * Passive decay: every real-time hour, hunger -5, cleanliness -2, happiness -1, energy -5 (use simple timer or platform default)
+- Cooldowns:
+  * Feed / Play / Bath / Sleep have small cooldowns (e.g., 10–30 seconds) to avoid spamming. Show cooldown visually on buttons.
+- Store currency:
+  * Use EXP as the in-game currency for purchases (or let generator create a separate "coins" currency if preferred).
+  * Buying items reduces EXP accordingly and updates inventory.
+- Inventory:
+  * Items can be used to restore stats or give EXP (e.g., Food item restores hunger and gives +5 EXP when used).
+- Autosave & Persistence:
+  * Persist all pet data and inventory in platform-provided storage. On reload, restore pets and states.
+- Accessibility:
+  * Large tap targets, readable fonts, high contrast. Provide labels for icons for screen readers.
+
+UI specifics (visual language)
+- Palette: Pastel gradient background (soft blue -> soft purple), accent colors for buttons (warm orange, teal).
+- Typography: Friendly rounded font, large headings.
+- Animations: Spin wheel physics, pet entrance bounce, small particle confetti when leveling up.
+- Sound: optional small chime on level-up and button tap (toggleable in settings).
+- Buttons: Big, rounded, with icon + label. Primary CTA color for Play/Spin, secondary for other actions.
+
+Behavioral hooks to increase retention (make it addictive and satisfying)
+- Level-up confetti and growth animations (satisfying visual feedback)
+- Small achievements/badges (e.g., "First Feed", "10 Plays", "First Level Up")
+- Daily bonus: every day the user opens the app give 5 EXP or a small food item
+- Unlock cosmetics and houses as rewards every N levels
+- Short-term goals (complete 3 plays to unlock a toy) and long-term goals (reach level 20 to unlock new pet wheel)
+
+Developer instruction (one line)
+- Do not implement external backend: use Mini App Factory’s default storage and state management. Implement front-end interactions, UI, and logic as described; generator may choose tech stack and persistence.
+
+Final note for generator:
+- All buttons and navigation must be functional and produce the described effect (update stats, award EXP, navigate screens). If the platform requires simplification, prioritize: Pet Selection spin wheel -> Name wheel -> About -> Home -> Store -> Pets -> House. Keep animations but keep logic simple and testable.
+
+End of prompt.
